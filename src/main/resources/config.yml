#
# A quest is a series of tasks which players must complete for a reward and may require a previous quest to start.
# A task is an objective such as breaking blocks or obtaining items.
# A reward is a command executed by the SERVER. Use {player} to get the players name.
#
# A quest can have a 'rewardstring' (this is optional). They will be sent to the player when they complete the quest.
# An example of the rewardstring in use can be seen in the quest example4.
#
# Each quest will have ONE "display" item, this is the item shown to the player in the GUI.
# The display item will have a "name", a "type" and TWO lores.
# The name is the name of the item, the type is the material and the lore is the text underneath the item (when mouse-over-ing).
# The first lore you must give is called 'lore-normal'. This is the lore seen if the player has not started the quest.
# The second lore you must give is 'lore-started'. This will be appended to the first lore IF the player has started the quest - useful for putting progression.
# Within the lores you can get the players" progress for each task. Use {TASKID:progress} (replace TASKID with the ID of the task).
# You can also get if a task is complete. Use {TASKID:complete} (replace TASKID with the ID of the task).
#
# Quests can be put inside a category. When a player does /quests they will first see a menu of categories. They can click one and another menu of quests
# under that category will show up. Categories can be disabled.
#
