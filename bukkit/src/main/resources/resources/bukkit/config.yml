        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain
        # in the pool. If the idle connections dip below this value and total connections in the pool are
        # less than maximum-pool-size, HikariCP will make the best effort to add additional connections
        # quickly and efficiently. However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands,
        # we recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a fixed size
        # connection pool. Default: same as maximum-pool-size
        # (*) Quests note:
        # The default value has been decreased to 8.
        minimum-idle: 8
        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and
        # in-use connections. Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual connections to
        # the database backend. A reasonable value for this is best determined by your execution environment.
        # When the pool reaches this size, and no idle connections are available, calls to getConnection() will
        # block for up to connection-timeout milliseconds before timing out. Please read about pool sizing
        # (https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing). Default: 10
        # (*) Quests note:
        # The default value has been decreased to 8.
        maximum-pool-size: 8
        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's you) will wait for
        # a connection from the pool. If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a SQLException
        # will be thrown. Lowest acceptable connection timeout is 250 ms. Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
        # (*) Quests note:
        # The default value has been decreased to 5000 as setting it to 30000 seems a bit too excessive.
        connection-timeout: 5000
        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. This
        # setting only applies when minimum-idle is defined to be less than maximum-pool-size. Idle connections will not
        # be retired once the pool reaches minimum-idle connections. Whether a connection is retired as idle or not is
        # subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average variation of +15 seconds. A connection will never
        # be retired as idle before this timeout. A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the
        # pool. The minimum allowed value is 10000ms (10 seconds). Default: 600000 (10 minutes)
        idle-timeout: 600000
        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls how frequently HikariCP will attempt to keep a connection alive, in order to
        # prevent it from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure. This value must be less
        # than the maximum-lifetime value. A "keepalive" will only occur on an idle connection. When the time
        # arrives for a "keepalive" against a given connection, that connection will be removed from the pool,
        # "pinged", and then returned to the pool. The 'ping' is one of either: invocation of the JDBC4 isValid()
        # method, or execution of the connectionTestQuery. Typically, the duration out-of-the-pool should be
        # measured in single digit milliseconds or even sub-millisecond, and therefore should have little or
        # no noticeable performance impact. The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds), but a value in
        # the range of minutes is most desirable. Default: 0 (disabled)
        keepalive-time: 0
        # (*) From HikariCP docs:
        # This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never
        # be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed. On a connection-by-connection basis, minor
        # negative attenuation is applied to avoid mass-extinction in the pool. We strongly recommend setting this
        # value, and it should be several seconds shorter than any database or infrastructure imposed connection
        # time limit. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject of course to the
        # idle-timeout setting. The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds). Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
        maximum-lifetime: 1800000
