== Examples ==
Place 10 of any block:

```yaml
building:
  type: "blockplace"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be placed
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
```

Place 10 of stone:

```yaml
buildingstone:
  type: "blockplace"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be placed
  block: STONE                          # name of block (minecraft name)
  data: 1                               # (OPTIONAL) data code
  reverse-if-broken: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true, blocks of same type broken will reverse progression (prevents silk-touch exploit)
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
```

Place 10 of either stone or gold ore:

```yaml
buildingmultiple:
  type: "blockplace"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be placed
  blocks:                               # name of blocks which will count towards progress
   - STONE
   - GOLD_ORE                           
  reverse-if-broken: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true, blocks of same type broken will reverse progression (prevents silk-touch exploit)
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
