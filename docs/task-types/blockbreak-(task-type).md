# blockbreak (task type)

Since v1.0
{: .label .label-green }

Break a set amount of blocks. For items which can be broken by
breaking a block underneath it (such as torches or signs), consider
using the [blockitemdropping task type](blockitemdropping-(task-type))
instead.

{: .note }
Since Quests v3.13, `blockbreakcertain` and `blockbreak` have been
merged into one. Both names can be used to refer to this task.

## Examples

Break 10 of any block:

``` yaml
mining:
  type: "blockbreak"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be broken
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
```

Break 10 of stone:

``` yaml
miningstone:
  type: "blockbreakcertain"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be broken
  block: STONE                          # name of block (can be id or minecraft name)
  data: 1                               # (OPTIONAL) data code 
  reverse-if-placed: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true, blocks of same type placed will reverse progression (prevents silk-touch exploit)
  check-coreprotect: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true and CoreProtect is present, the plugin will check its logs for player placed blocks
  check-coreprotect-time: 3600          # (OPTIONAL) time in seconds for the maximum logging period to check
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
```

Break 10 of either stone or gold ore:

``` yaml
miningmultiple:
  type: "blockbreakcertain"
  amount: 10                            # amount of blocks to be broken
  blocks:                               # name of blocks which will count towards progress
   - STONE
   - GOLD_ORE                           
  reverse-if-placed: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true, blocks of same type placed will reverse progression (prevents silk-touch exploit)
  check-coreprotect: false              # (OPTIONAL) if true and CoreProtect is present, the plugin will check its logs for player placed blocks
  check-coreprotect-time: 3600          # (OPTIONAL) time in seconds for the maximum logging period to check
