{: .caution }
It's not possible to use item option for projectile weapons (like bow or other projectile shooters). Currently, the API is insufficient to implement such a feature without any unwanted side effects.

## Examples

Deal 100 HP of damage:

``` yaml
dealdamage:
  type: "dealdamage"
  amount: 100                           # amount of damage inflicted (HP)
  worlds:                               # (OPTIONAL) restrict to certain worlds
   - "world"
```
