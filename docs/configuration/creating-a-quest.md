# Creating a quest
{: .no_toc }

Each file inside the `quests` subfolder represents a
single quest. The **name** of the file represents the **quest id** and
must be alphanumeric (excluding the .yml extension).

{: .note }
An example can be seen in the [default
configuration](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests/blob/master/bukkit/src/main/resources/resources/bukkit/quests/example1.yml).

## Table of contents

## Quest ID

The quest ID is the name of the file (excluding .yml extension) and must
alphanumeric and unique. This ID is used as the reference in commands,
players' quest progress file and in placeholders.

## Tasks

  
*`tasks`*

Tasks are the objectives the player must do to complete the quest.
Simalar to quest IDs, there are task IDs. They can be identical to the
quest ID but must be unique to each other.

For help on adding the tasks, refer to [task configuration
layout](../task-types)

## Display

  
*`display`*

This is the item which will be shown to the player in the quest GUI.

### Name

  
*`display.name`*

``` yaml
display:
  name: "&cExample I (Single Task)"
```

### Normal lore

  
*`display.lore-normal`*

The lore (description) of the item as seen if the quest is not started.

```

### Started lore

  
*`display.lore-started`*

The lore (description) of the item **appended to `lore-normal`** if the
quest is started. This is a good place to put progression details. To
get the progression of a player in a task, write `{TASKID:progress}` and
replace `TASKID` with the ID of the task you want to get the progress
for. Alternatively, you can write `{TASKID:complete}` to get if the task
is complete.

``` yaml
display:
  # ...
  lore-started:
    - ""
    - "&7Your current progression:"
    - "&7 - &f{mining:progress}&7/30 blocks broken."
```

### Type

  
*`display.type`*

The type (material name) of item.

``` yaml
display:
  # ...
  type: "WOODEN_PICKAXE"
```

## Rewards

  
*`rewards`*

**Optional.** This is a list of commands which will be executed when the
player completes the quest. You can use `{player}` and the players name
will be substituted in place.

``` yaml
rewards:
  - "give {player} diamond 10"
```

## Start commands

  
*`startcommands`*

**Optional.** This is a list of commands which will be executed when the
player starts the quest. You can use `{player}` and the player's name
will be substituted in place.

  - "broadcast {player} has started a quest"
```

## Cancel commands


*`cancelcommands`*

**Optional.** This is a list of commands which will be executed when the
player cancels the quest. You can use `{player}` and the player's name
will be substituted in place.

``` yaml
cancelcommands:
  - "broadcast {player} has cancelled a quest"
```

## Expiry commands


*`expirycommands`*

**Optional.** This is a list of commands which will be executed when the
the player's quest expires. You can use `{player}` and the player's name
will be substituted in place.

``` yaml
expirycommands:
  - "broadcast {player}'s quest has expired"
```

## Start string

  
*`startstring`*

**Optional.** This is a list of messages which will be sent to the
player when they start the quest. This is useful for telling the player
their objectives.

``` yaml
startstring:
 - " &8- &7You must break 30 blocks."
```

player their rewards.

rewardstring:
 - " &8- &7You have received 10 dimaonds."
```

## Placeholders

  
*`placeholders`*

**Optional.** This is a set of placeholders which can be accessed using
PlaceholderAPI. To get the progression of a player in a task, write
`{TASKID:progress}` and replace `TASKID` with the ID of the task you
want to get the progress for. Alternatively, you can write
`{TASKID:complete}` to get if the task is complete.

``` yaml
placeholders:
  description: "&7Break &f30 blocks &7of any type."
  progress: " &8- &f{mining:progress}&7/30 broken"
```

These placeholders will be called using PlaceholderAPI. See [quest
progress in scoreboard](../guides/quest-progress-in-scoreboard) for a
guide which utilises this feature.

## Progress placeholders

*`progress-placeholders`*

**Optional.** This is a list of placeholders which represent the progress
of each task. These are used by the [bossbar](/configuration/basic-options#bossbar)
and [actionbar](/configuration/basic-options#actionbar) configuration options.

You can define a placeholder for each task, or for all of them as a catch-all.

```yaml
progress-placeholders:
  <task-name>: "Progress for <task-name>"
  '*': "Progress for tasks not defined above"
```

For example, in an actual quest:

```yaml
tasks:
  mining:
    type: "blockbreak"
    amount: 100
  building:
    type: "blockplace"
    amount: 100
# ... 
progress-placeholders:
  mining: "&f{mining:progress}/100 &7blocks broken"
  building: "&f{building:progress}/100 &7blocks placed"
```
